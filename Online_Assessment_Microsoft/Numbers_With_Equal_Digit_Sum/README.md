## Numbers With Equal Digit Sum

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/365872/

Given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum. 
If there are no two numbers whose digits have an equal sum, the function should return -1.

Conditions:

*   N is an integer within the range [1, ..., 200,000]
*   each element of array A is an integer within the range [1, ..., 1,000,000,000]

**Example 1:**

    Input: A = [51, 61, 17, 42]
    Output: [93]
    Explanation:
    The function should return 93. There are two paris of numbers whose digits ad up to an equal sum: (51, 42) and (17, 71). The first pare sums up to 93.
